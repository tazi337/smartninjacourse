    <!--
        Tip: The <div> element is very often used together with CSS, to layout a web page.

        Note: By default, browsers always place a line break before and after the <div> element.
        However, this can be changed with CSS.

        The <section> tag defines sections in a document,
        such as chapters, headers, footers, or any other sections of the document.

    <!--
        The <article> tag specifies independent, self-contained content.

        An article should make sense on its own and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the site.

        Potential sources for the <article> element:

        Forum post
        Blog post
        News story
        Comment
