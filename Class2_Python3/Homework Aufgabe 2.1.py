### HOMEWORK 2.1 ###

# UNIT CONVERTER #

#Create a program that converts units. Specifically kilometers into miles.

#First create a plan for this program. Together with the instructor define the steps the user will take when using the program.

# Plan:
#
# The program greets user and describes what's the purpose of the program.
# The program asks user to enter number of kilometers.
# User enters the amount of kilometers.
# The program converts these kilometers into miles and prints them.
# The program asks user if s/he'd want to do another conversion.
# If yes, repeat the above process (except the greeting).
# If not, the program says goodbye and stops.


# The program should constantly run as long as the user would want to do conversions.

# When you finish, paste your code on GitHub Gist and share it on the SmartNinja forum.
