### HOMEWORK 2.2 ###

# FIZZBUZZ #
# User enters a number between 1 and 100
# FizzBuzz program starts to count to that number (it prints them in the Terminal). In case the number is divisible with 3, it prints "fizz" instead of the number. If the number is divisible with 5, it prints "buzz". If it's divisible with both 3 and 5, it prints "fizzbuzz".

# Example:

# Select a number between 1 and 100
# 16
#
# 1
# 2
# fizz
# 4
# buzz
# fizz
# 7
# 8
# fizz
# buzz
# 11
# fizz
# 13
# 14
# fizzbuzz
# 16



# A tip for this project:
#
# How to find a division remainder
#
# If a division remainder is 0, that means some number is divisible with another (without remainder).
#
# Example:
#
# print(15 % 5)
# print(15 % 4)
# 15 is divisible with 5, so the remainder is 0. But 15 is not divisible with 4, so the remainder is not 0.
