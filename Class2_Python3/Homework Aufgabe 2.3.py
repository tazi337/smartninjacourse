# Sometimes you'd like to make some string lowercase. For example, you have a string like this:
#
# "Today Is A BeautiFul DAY"
# And you'd like to make it like this:
#
# "today is a beautiful day"
# There is a very nice solution in Python to do this. Use Google search and find out how to do it.
#
# Where would this come handy? For example if you ask user "Would you like to continue (yes/no)?", the user might respond: "yes", "Yes", "YES" or even "YeS". In this case, changing your user's response into lowercase letters would be very helpful in your if-else statement.
#
# When you finish, paste your code on GitHub Gist and share it on the SmartNinja forum.
